# covid_database_query

## Project

Implemented relational database and nonrelational database to capture 3 datasets (Our World in Data, Country response measures to COVID-19, and Community Mobility Reports). This is to address the infodemic, that is, an over-abundance of information on COVID-19, a crucial part of responding to the pandemic.
